# THz-GA-characterization-code
The codes in Matlab to process the data acquired from the multi-configuration THz ellipsometry. The processing is based on Genetic Algorithm

Use the "run_all.m" to process all data measured from 1-31 min,
or use "Exp_fit_ellip.m" to process a single file.
The data named with "Exp_ratio_left_minX.mat" are experimental ratios between of the forearms and the references.
The data named with "results_left_phase20_minX.mat" are the processed results. New processing will overwrite these result files.
